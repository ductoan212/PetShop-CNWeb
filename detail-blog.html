                <h5>10 Tips for Getting Instagram Worthy Photos of You with Your Dog While Traveling</h5>
            </header>
            <div id="content-blog">
                Dog friendly travel is a great opportunity for influencers, bloggers, and small business owners alike to add new, interesting, and unique photos to their social media and general marketing repertoire. However, if you’re anything like us, you often find
                yourself behind the camera and not in front of it with your dog and the products you’re selling.
                <br> Showing your face in marketing materials and social media can help potential customers feel a connection to you and even grow the connection you have with existing customers. While we do think our dogs should shine, we also think
                you should be present because you are a huge part of your business’s story.
                <br>This post is presented by Sleepypod, who is teaming up with the new Amazon Original unscripted competitive reality series, The Pack. The Pack exemplifies the human-animal bond as it follows 12 dogs and their human partners tackling
                challenges together while traveling around the globe. The series will premiere on November 20 on Prime Video. Packed Weekend also launches the same day, three days of deals, delights, and experiences for dogs and dog lovers alike to further
                their bond. Brands like Sleepypod will celebrate Packed Weekend with discounts, giveaways, and upgrades.
                <br> While traveling with your dog is exciting and fun, remember that it’s easy to pick a location close to home to visit. If you do travel to other cities, states, or even countries, CDC guidelines strongly recommend checking local guidelines
                for any travel during COVID.
                <h6> 1. Research & Plan Ahead</h6>
                This is a very common theme in this article, but it’s so important to be prepared. An amazing benefit of travel is that we get to see and explore places that are new and often unknown to us. This can also make something task oriented like getting a great
                photo with your dog stressful and challenging.
                <br>No matter what you want your experience to stay positive and happy, so gathering as much information ahead of time is a great way to reduce possible issues. Research the place you are going to find out if there are any amazing photo
                spots that you don’t want to miss. If you find any must see locations that are extremely popular, try scheduling those visits for a less busy time so both you and your dog can be more focused on yourselves and on getting a few amazing
                photos.
                <br> While we know it might change, look into the weather ahead of time. This research should give you a decent idea of when to plan your outdoor photo sessions. Also keep in mind the times for sunrise and sunset in case you want to take
                advantage of the golden hours.
